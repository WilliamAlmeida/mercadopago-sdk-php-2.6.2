## Notice: Personal Use Only

This library provides developers with a simple set of bindings to integrate the Mercado Pago API into a website and start receiving payments. This version is a clone of the original Mercado Pago package at the same Tag version 2.6.2. However, namespaces have been corrected to avoid loading issues when used with Laravel 9 or higher, due to the transition from Composer 1 to Composer 2 (PSR-4).

---

**Notice:** This version is intended for personal use only. If you choose to use this version in your projects, you do so at your own risk. I opted to maintain this version due to its use in personal and client projects, with no plans to migrate to version 3 of the SDK.

---

## üí° Requirements

PHP 5.6, 7.1 or higher

## üíª Installation 

First time using Mercado Pago? Create your [Mercado Pago account](https://www.mercadopago.com), if you don‚Äôt have one already.

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if not already installed

2. On your project directory run on the command line
`composer require "composer require "WilliamAlmeida/mercadopago-sdk-php-2.6.2"` for Laravel ^9.0.

3. Copy the access_token in the [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com/mlb/account/credentials) section of the page and replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with it.

That's it! Mercado Pago SDK has been successfully installed.

## üåü Getting Started
  
  Simple usage looks like:
  
```php
  <?php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; // You have to require the library from your Composer vendor folder

    MercadoPago\SDK::setAccessToken("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"); // Either Production or SandBox AccessToken

    $payment = new MercadoPago\Payment();
    
    $payment->transaction_amount = 141;
    $payment->token = "YOUR_CARD_TOKEN";
    $payment->description = "Ergonomic Silk Shirt";
    $payment->installments = 1;
    $payment->payment_method_id = "visa";
    $payment->payer = array(
      "email" => "larue.nienow@email.com"
    );

    $payment->save();

    echo $payment->status;
  ?>
```
